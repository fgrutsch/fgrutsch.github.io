My name is Fabian Grutsch and I am working as a Backend Engineer at [Firstbird](https://firstbird.com) where we are building an SaaS referral platform using Scala, Akka, Playframework and AWS. |

Currently, I am living in my hometown which is based in Tyrol (Austria). As Firstbird has its HQ in Vienna (Austria) I am working for more than 3 years now from a Coworking Space.

I love nature and adventure, especially hiking, ski touring, mountain biking and exploring the alps. Other than that I am also interested in contributing to open source projects, professionally and in private.
